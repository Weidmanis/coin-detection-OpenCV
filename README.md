# coin-detection-OpenCV


This is a capstone project from a UDemy course ('Name of the course')
The objective of the project was:
    - Circle coins in the given image using OpenCV tools
    - Figure out what is the total sum of the round coins in the given image

Comments in the code should be enough to explain the thought process and steps taken
